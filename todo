Add/Edit Item Page
-  there should be a cancel, or back-to-dashboard link
- form validation should NOT be server-side. that should be JS at best, php at worst.

Dashboard - Entry
- delete post works, but takes you to this white screen that you need to navigate away from yourself. At the very least this should kick you back to the dashboard after the entry is deleted.

--edit_user script needs to be more discriminatory
--tags links are doing nothing
--postings display mysql error
--business info doesnt display tags
