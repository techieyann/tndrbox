Cream README
----------------------------------

This is the source code repository for the cream engine
of tinderbox. This engine consists of two different user
models: consumer and business. Businesses can edit their
relevant data and display page aesthetics, as well as 
submit and edit postings. Consumers can edit their list
of prioritized tags, and edit their relevant data.

Consumers and businesses interact through the tag engine.
Businesses choose (3) relevant tags for each post and (2)
for themselves. Consumers input tags they are interested
in finding more about. An individuals homepage then 
consists of a list of postings from businesses ranked by
distance and correlation to interest. If the individual 
is linked to a business the relevant statistics and 
options are displayed as well.

The default landing page consists of a search bar and
listing of posts sorted by trending tags and distance.
The search bar allows a user to enter a tag they want
to filter for.

Presently, the file structure of the source tree is as
follows:

/
/includes/
/scripts/

The root dir is for css and web page scripts. /includes/
contains the global definitions of variables and 
functions, and /scripts/ contains the code which
interacts with the databases.
