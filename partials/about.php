<div id="about" class="content">

<p>tndrbox is an online community events board built by two native Oaklanders for Oakland.</p>

<p>A place where local businesses and visitors, community groups and neighbors, can promote the projects they care about that shape our city.</p>

<p>New bike lanes, a sweet new workshop, community cleanup days, the latest culinary creation--these are the things that make Oakland and our communities uniquely ours. We want to help those projects succeed, and the neighborhoods they’re in along with them, by connecting like-minded residents together.</p>

<p>Gardeners discovering a local guerilla gardening spree, beer lovers knowing a new brew just came in on tap around the corner. A place online where common interests and neighborhoods intersect, where neighbors and common goals spark new action and forge stronger communities.</p>

<p>We didn’t built tndrbox to be another social network—we built it because we know there’s a better way to discover and participate for every block.</p>
