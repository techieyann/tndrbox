				       <h3>What tndrbox?</h3>
					   <p>tndrbox is a realtime, grassroots newspaper. A groundswell momentum generator. A why-isn't-somebody-doing-that idea broadcaster. A local flavor combinator. A how-many-of-this-do-I-order, direct-to-your-customers landline. A speak common sense to power megaphone. A grassroots cause ignition system. A community incubator. A make the world a better place machine. </p>

       	     	       <h3>Why tndrbox?</h3>
					   <p>Because broadcasting witticisms or what beer you're drinking right now is useless. Because the roots of the city around you go deeper than anyone can imagine and what's down there is the lifeblood of your community. Because you want to know what is happening in your city and what you can do about it, with it, for it.</p>
					   <p>You want to participate, not consume. You want to be present, not show up. You want to be a part of something, not in attendance.</p>
					   <p>So do we. Welcome.</p>

				       <h3>Who tndrbox?</h3>
				       <p>We are Oakland natives who love our town. We're building the site that we need to connect to the community around us - a site that does what we love.</p>
					   <p>We're tired of social media blasts that mean nothing, hip city guides that ask us to spend our paycheck on fashionable frivolity and mass coupons that undercut small businesses. We want to grow with our community as a part of it, helping it grow not just financially, but stronger and more vibrant as the fabric that makes up our city.</p>
